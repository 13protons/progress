# Progress

Radial progress bars are hard. This is an angular directive to render one for you in SVG! You can control all the parameter you wish - radius, stroke weight, percentage done, color etc. 

No animation yet, and it may not be possible to do simply due to the use of the svg `arc` drawing method. 

## Get Up and running

```
npm install
bower install
gulp
```

Route to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)
